   - one of the tests assumed certain ports would be closed when they really
     might not be ; another test assumes this also, but port7 → port7 should
     normally be closed.
   - I definitely do want the build to fail on non /proc/net/tcp systems, but I
     don't want reports about it.  I couldn't remember the syntax in 603 —
     fixed in 604.

   - I thought BSD had a /proc/net/tcp ; but now that I think about
     it.  it doesn't.  There's probably a great cross platform way
     to look this stuff up, but I don't know it.  This is an easy
     fix for now.

   - there's enough docbugs to increment this thing again.

   - just noticed I was going to use Net::IP, but didn't actually do
     it...
   - (and didn't put it in the Makefile.PL)

   - trying to resurrect this … maybe I should just use BINGOS’ POE
     server
   - redid the tests
   - fixed up some strange old codes
   - removed the strange config reader and re-exposed new() from
     Net::Server
